# LÖVE CRT Effect
A CRT simulation done in LÖVE 0.9.2.  
The code is kinda sloppy, but I figured I might as well share it for those who are interested.

Features:
 - Tube Distortion
 - Edge Fringing
 - Horizontal Blur
 - Brightness/Contrast Adjustments
 - NTSC Artifacts Overlay
 - Shadow Mask Overlay
 - Light Overlay

(Roughly) adapted from Kyle Pittman's CRT simulation:
