![http://i.imgur.com/Tar0T4L.png](http://i.imgur.com/Suu9dBu.png)

A CRT simulation done in LÖVE 0.9.2.  
The code is kinda sloppy, but I figured I might as well share it for those who are interested.

Features:
 - Tube Distortion
 - Edge Fringing
 - Horizontal Blur
 - Brightness/Contrast Adjustments
 - NTSC Artifacts + Shadow Mask Overlay
 - Included Bezel/Light Overlay

(Roughly) adapted from Kyle Pittman's CRT simulation:
