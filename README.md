# LÖVE CRT Effect
![http://www.kaype.co/img/crt.png](http://www.kaype.co/img/crt.png)

A CRT simulation done in LÖVE 0.9.2.  
The code is a bit sloppy, but I figured I might as well share it for the people interested.

Features:
 - Tube Distortion
 - Edge 'Fringing'
 - Brightness/Contrast Adjustments
 - NTSC Artifacts + Shadow Mask Overlay
 - Included Bezel/Light Overlay

Note: You'll have to recreate the overlay to fit which aspect ratio you want. I recommend using 3x scaling.

(Roughly) adapted from Kyle Pittman's CRT simulation:
