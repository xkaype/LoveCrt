# LÖVE CRT Effect
![http://i.imgur.com/2yedP4a.png](http://i.imgur.com/2yedP4a.png)

A CRT simulation done in LÖVE 0.9.2.  
The code is kinda sloppy, but I figured I might as well share it for those who are interested.

Features:
 - Tube Distortion
 - Edge Fringing
 - Horizontal Blur
 - Brightness/Contrast Adjustments
 - NTSC Artifacts + Shadow Mask Overlay
 - Included Bezel/Light Overlay

Note: You'll have to recreate the overlay to fit the aspect ratio you want.

(Roughly) adapted from Kyle Pittman's CRT simulation:
